# Clickbot with Keys and Origins

This tool simulates real user behavior on Google Maps using rotating search keywords and origin points. It clicks on a target listing (like Eunoia Medispa), enters directions from a rotating list of origin locations, and scrolls to simulate human activity.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/princeshergill/Clickbotwithkeysandorigins.git
cd Clickbotwithkeysandorigins
